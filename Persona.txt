Scenario:
	
	Persona nº 1: Anabela changed of schools, and is finding very hard to keep up with all the new people that she is meeting and what is going on around the world, so she figured that she would use trendit; trendit would not olny trim a lot of time on the social networks, but also let her know about what topics related to something (a band, an actress...) where the most popular (a music, a movie...), so she can talk about it with a friend that has the same tastes.
	
	Persona nº 2: Joshua wants to optimize the work done on his company, so he figured out which parts were spending the most time on the development of a new product. One of the hard parts of the work is finding the right thing to create a product, it is one of the most important parts of the work, because it will be the starting point of the work, everything will be builded up from there, so it is crucial that this part not only is really certain, but also fast; and one of the arduous tasks in this work is data research, it would be really useful to be able to see what is currently trending on Canada; thankfully, trendit exists, and it helps Joshua and his employees by ordering trends by popularity and also by age bracket, topics...
