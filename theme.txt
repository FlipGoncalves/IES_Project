Sample project theme: Twitter Trends Bot

⎯ Goal: Publish descriptive information about the trends all over the world, seen from twitter, as well as statistic information about them in relation with the user

⎯ Data acquisition layer: twitter bot which collects data from all tweets by likes/trending

⎯ Data publishing: every time the page is refreshed, the bot will run and gain more information, change information, delete information, etc.

⎯ Processing & bizz logic: when users tweet something and it gets a lot of likes/shares, we can see that people like it, so it represents a trend

⎯ Integration API: REST Api, with database connection

⎯ Web portal: web application to show us information about the trends all over the world, as well as statistic information
